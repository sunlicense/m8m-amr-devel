# change directory to /usr/src
cd /usr/src

# if you have any other drivers installed,remove them like so:
rm -r rtl8812AU-4.3.22/

# get latest driver from github
git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au

# move into downloaded driver folder
cd rtl8812au/

# make drivers
make

sudo make install

reboot

It works
